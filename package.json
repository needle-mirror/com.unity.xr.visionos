    "changelog": "### Added\n\n### Changed\n\n### Deprecated\n\n### Removed\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed a bug where VR (Metal rendering) apps using foveated rendering would appear warped and distorted on visionOS 2.2. This bug affects all VR apps built with `com.unity.xr.visionos` versions `1.1.4` and `1.1.6`. It was fixed in version `1.2.3`, and relates to the `setFoveatedRenderingEnabled` API in the XR plugin, which did not exist prior to version `1.1.4`. No `2.x` package versions are affected. Fixing this bug requires you to update this package and re-build your project out of Unity. You will need to submit a new build to the App Store if your app is affected. No Unity Editor update is needed. The bug and its fix are specific to this package (`com.unity.xr.visionos`).\n\n### Security"
